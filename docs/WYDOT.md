#WYDOT Documentation

This project is currently working with the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) as one of the Connected Vehicle (CV) Pilot sites
to showcase the value of and spur the adoption of CV Technology in the United States.

As one of the three selected pilots, WYDOT is focusing on improving safety and mobility by creating new ways to communicate road and travel information to commercial truck drivers and fleet managers along the 402 miles of Interstate 80 (I-80 henceforth) in the State. For the pilot project, WYDOT will work in a planning phase through September 2016. The deployment process will happen in the second phase (ending in September 2017) followed by an 18-month demonstration period in the third phase (starting in October 2017).

## Project Goals
The current project goals for the ODE have been developed specifically for the use case of WYDOT. Additional capabilities and system functions are planned for later releases.

- **Collect CV Data:** Connected vehicle data from field may be collected from vehicle OBUs directly or through RSUs. Data collected include Basic Safety Messages Part I and Part 2, Event Logs and other probe data (weather sensors, etc.). These messages are ingested into the operational data environment (ODE) where the data is then further channeled to other subsystems.
- **Support Data Brokerage:** The WYDOT Data Broker is a sub-system that is responsible for interfacing with various WYDOT Transportation Management Center (TMC) systems gathering information on current traffic conditions, incidents, construction, operator actions and road conditions. The data broker then distributes information from PikAlert, the ODE and the WYDOT
interfaces based on business rules. The data broker develops a traveler information message (TIM) for segments on I-80, and provide event or condition information back to the WYDOT interfaces
- **Distribute traveler information messages (TIM):** The data broker distributes the TIM message to the operational data environment (ODE) which will then communicate the message back to the OBUs, RSUs and the situational data exchange (SDX)
- **Store data:** Data generated by the system (both from the field and the back-office sub-systems)
are stored in the WYDOT data warehouse.
